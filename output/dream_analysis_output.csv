Just as I was about to fall, I suddenly grew wings 🕊️ and started flying over the landscape, feeling a sense of freedom and relief. I looked down and saw my childhood home 🏠 burning 🔥 in the distance. Then I woke up with my heart pounding 💓.","a dark forest 🌲, a rushing river 🌊, a snake 🐍, forest, moon, snake, the moon 🌕, 🌊, 🌕, 🌲, 🐍, 🔥","This dream reveals a profound emotional struggle for freedom and liberation from the constraints of the past.

• Sleep Hygiene Tip: Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine to improve the quality of your sleep and increase your chances of entering a lucid dream state.
